    <h1>Application 6 Demo</h1>

    <p>
      This page shows my demo for Application 6 in Real-Time Systems.  
      The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate a working real-time program,
      upload a short video walkthrough, and host everything on a simple GitHub Pages site.
    </p>

    <h2>Video Demo</h2>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      For this assignment, I created a small real-time application that demonstrates
      concepts like task scheduling, timing guarantees, and predictable system behavior.
      Even though this is a lightweight version of a full project, it still highlights
      the core ideas behind designing software that responds within specific time limits.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      The program uses multiple tasks that run at different time intervals.  
      A key idea in real-time systems is ensuring that high-priority tasks always run
      when needed, even when the processor is busy.  
      The application also demonstrates deterministic timing, meaning the system responds
      the same way every time under the same conditions.  
      This small demo acts as a foundation for larger real-time applications where timing,
      safety, and predictability matter.

    <h2>About This Site</h2>
    <p>
      This webpage was created as part of the assignment to learn how to host a project
      using GitHub Pages. The steps included creating a repository, enabling GitHub Pages,
      writing a simple HTML file, and embedding a public YouTube video using an iframe.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a real project, this website could expand into a full documentation page with
      detailed explanations, code walkthroughs, diagrams, and downloadable files.
